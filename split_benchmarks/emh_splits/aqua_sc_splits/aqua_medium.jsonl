Any integer that is a multiple of 2 is an even number. So, q must be a positive even integer.\nWith these two observations, the question can be simplified to:what is the units digit of 4 raised to an even positive integer?\nThe units digit of 4 raised to an integer follows a specific repeating pattern:\n4^1 = 4\n4^2 = 16\n4^3 = 64\n4^4 = 256\n4^(odd number) --> units digit of 4\n4^(even number) --> units digit of 6\nThere is a clear pattern regarding the units digit. 4 raised to any odd integer has a units digit of 4 while 4 raised to any even integer has a units digit of 6.\nSince q must be an even integer, the units digit of p=4^q will always be 6.

For example, If we were measuring by the time the very front of the train passed one end of the platform to the time the very front of the train passed the other end, the result would be different than if we counted when the very front of the train passed one end of the platform to the time the back side of the train passed the end.\nAs for the problem involving the man, the man is standing still while the train is moving forward at a speed of 25km/h. Therefore, the train is moving past the man at a total speed of 25km/h.\ndistance = speed * time\ndistance = 25km/h * 12 seconds\ndistance (length of train) = 83.3 m\nWe know the length of the train is roughly 83.3m and the distance covered passing the platform was 125m.

If you divide any odd number by 4, you will get a remainder of either 1 or 3. That's not a rule unique to prime numbers at all.\nThe 6C+1 or 6C-1 rule is basically every odd number that is not divisible by three, so it narrows the search a little.\nHere's how I thought about the problem. First, eliminate all the even numbers and the odd multiples of 5 in that range. That leaves us with:\n{201, 203, 207, 209, 211, 213, 217, 219}\nEliminate the four multiples of 3. Notice that 21 is a multiple of 3, so 210 is also a multiple of 3. If we add or subtract 3 or 9, we get more multiples of three. When we eliminate those, we are left with.\n{203, 209, 211, 217}\nNow, notice that a cool thing about this range is that 210 is also a multiple 7 (again, because 21 is a multiple of 7). This means that\n210 - 7 = 203\n210 + 7 = 217\nThose two numbers are also multiples of 7, so eliminate them from the list. Now, we are left with\n{209, 211}.\nWe've already checked all the prime numbers less than 10, so we know that neither of these numbers is divisible by anything less than 10. We have to check 11 now. We know that 22 is a multiple of 11, so 220 is also a multiple of 11. This means that\n220 - 11 = 209\nis also a multiple of 11. We can eliminate this from the list also.\nThat leaves us with just 211. There's no zero option in the question, so this must be a prime number.\nAnswer = (A)", "correct": "A", "difficulty_score": 5}
