Pick an easysmartnumber to make this problem easier. Usually, the smart number is the lowest common denominator of all the fractions in the problem. However, if you pick 28, you will quickly see that this yields some unwieldy computation.\nThe easiest number to work with in this problem is the number 4. Let's say there are 4 liters of water originally in the lake. The question then becomes: During which year is the lake reduced to less than 1 liter of water?\nAt the end of 2076, there are 4 \u00d7 (5/7) or 20/7 liters of water in the lake. This is not less than 1.\nAt the end of 2077, there are (20/7) \u00d7 (5/7) or 100/49 liters of water in the lake. This is not less than 1.\nAt the end of 2078, there are (100/49) \u00d7 (5/7) or 500/343 liters of water in the lake. This is not less than 1.\nAt the end of 2079, there are (500/343) \u00d7 (5/7) or 2500/2401 liters of water in the lake. This is not less than 1.\nAt the end of 2080, there are (2500/2401) \u00d7 (5/7) or 12500/16807 liters of water in the lake. This is less than 1.\nNotice that picking the number 4 is essential to minimizing the computation involved, since it is very easy to see when a fraction falls below 1 (when the numerator becomes less than the denominator.) The only moderately difficult computation involved is multiplying the denominator by 7 for each new year.\nThe correct answer is D.", "correct": "D", "difficulty_score": 2}

The question states:S is a set containing 9 different positive odd primes. T is a set containing 8 different numbers, all of which are members of S. Which of the following statements CANNOT be true?\n(A) The median of S is prime.\nThismust be true. If there are an odd number of members of a set, then the median is a member of the set: it's the middle number, when all the numbers are ranked from smallest to biggest. Every number in S is a positive odd prime, so the median is one of them, and is prime.\n(B) The median of T is prime.\nThismay or may not be true. If a set has an even number of members, the median is average of the two numbers in the middle, when ranked from smallest to biggest. The average of two odd numberscould beeven (average of 71 and 73 is 72), and hence not prime, or itcould beodd (the average of 71 and 79 is 75). For particularly well chosen odd numbers, the average can be not only odd but also prime -- for example, the average of 89 and 113 is 101, another prime number. If the two middle numbers of T were 89 and 113, the median would be 101, a prime number.\n(C) The median of S is equal to the median of T.\nUnder most configurations for S and T, this wouldn't happen. If you weren't trying to make it happen, it would be unlikely to happen by chance. BUT, if the number dropped going from from S to T was the median of S (say, 101), and if the two middle numbers of T happen to have an average of that number that was dropped (for example, if the two numbers were 89 and 113), then the medians would be equal. In other words, the three middle numbers of S would have to be {. . ., 89, 101, 133, . . .}, and when 101 is dropped in going to T, the median of two would be the average of 89113, which happens to be 101. It's an exceptional case, but itcouldbe true.\n(D) The sum of the terms in S is prime.\nThismay or may not be true. The sum of 9 odd numbermustbe an odd number. That odd numbercould beprime. For example, the sum of the first nine odd prime numbers {3, 5, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29} is 127, which is prime. If you drop 3 and include the next prime, 31, the set {5, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31} has a sum of 155, which is clearly not prime.\n(E) The sum of the terms in T is prime.\nThismust be false. The sum of eight odd numbers must be an even number. Only 2 is prime, and all other even numbers are not. Therefore, the sum of eight odd prime numbers will be an even number bigger than two, and absolutely cannot be prime.\nC", "correct": "C", "difficulty_score": 3}

We know this is the smallest number possible because prime factors by definition cannot be broken down any further.\nTherefore, we can go with answer choice C.\nIf time permits, we can do a sanity check.

But before we do that, here is an important note:\nNote: We cannot just cancel off the common terms in the numerator and denominator to get the remainder. But, if we want to cancel off to simplify the question, we can do it, provided we remember to multiply it back again.\nSo say, we want to find the remainder when 14 is divided by 10 i.e. 14/10 (remainder 4). But we cancel off the common 2 to get 7/5. The remainder here will be 2 which is not the same as the remainder obtained by dividing 14 by 10. But if we multiply 2 back by 2 (the number we canceled off), the remainder will become 2*2 = 4 which is correct.\nTake another example to reinforce this \u2013 what is the remainder when 85 is divided by 20? It is 5.\nWe might rephrase it as \u2013 what is the remainder when 17 is divided by 4 (cancel off 5 from the numerator and the denominator). The remainder in this case is 1. We multiply the 5 back to 1 to get the remainder as 5 which is correct.\nSo keeping this very important point in mind, let\u2019s go ahead and cancel the common 5 and 2.\nWe need the\nRemainder of (63*7*37*41*71*41*5*2)/10*5*2\nRemainder of (63*7*37*41*71*41)/10\nNow using concept 2, let\u2019s write the numbers in form of multiples of 10\nRemainder of (60+3)*7*(30+7)*(40+1)*(70+1)*(40+1)/10\nRemainder of 3*7*7*1*1*1/10\nRemainder of 147/10 = 7\nNow remember, we had canceled off 10 so to get the actual remainder so we need to multiply by 10: 7*10 = 70.\nWhen 63*35*37*82*71*41 is divided by 100, the remainder is 70.

So we can't just take 9+14=23. Find the Number of multiples of 6 (which are the double counted, as 6 is divisible by both 2 and 3), and subtract it from 23:\nStep 1. Subtract the extreme multiples of 6 within the range (The greatest is 72, the smallest is 54): 72 - 54 = 18\nStep 2. Divide by 6: 18 / 6 = 3\nStep 3. Add 1: 3 + 1 = 4.\nSo there are 4 multiples of 6 within the range: we counted 4 numbers twice.\nSubtract the 4 multiples of 6 from the sum of the multiples of 2 and 3:\n= 9 + 14 - 4\n= 23 - 4\n= 19\nTherefore, the final number of multiples of 2, 3 or 6 is 19.\nHence, this is the correct answer.
