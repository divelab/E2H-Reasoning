Another way to look at the formula is Sum = Average x Number of Terms. For the first purchase, the vendor's sum (total cost) was $140, since 14 x 10 = 140. For the second purchase, the vendor's cost was $165, since 11 x 15 = 165. The grand sum is then $140 + $165, which equals $305. The total number of shirts purchased was 25, so to get the average price per shirt, we divide 305 by 25, which equals $12.20. As a result, the correct answer is A.\nNOTE: A relative understanding of weighted average offers a shortcut to this problem. Because the true average of 11 and 14 is 12.5, but the vendor sells more shirts at the lower price than at the higher price, the weighted average must be less than $12.50; only answer choice A is a possibility.", "difficulty_score": 11, "answer": "A"}

Since Y = 2Z, the sum of Y and Z is (2Z) + Z = 3Z. This means that the BIGGEST factor is a MULTIPLE OF 3 (and likely one of the larger multiples of 3 in the answer choices).\nThe second piece of information tells us...\nX+Y+Z = 26\nBy extension...\nX+(Y+Z) = 26\nX+(larger multiple of 3) = 26\nFrom the answer choices, there are really only 2 options that make any sense: Answers D and E....\nWith Answer D:\nIF....Y+Z = 12, then X= 14, but....\nThe first piece of information tells us that X = 1/4 of Z, so X has to be relatively small....In this example, it's LARGER than Z, so D is NOT the answer. At this point, the answer would have to be E, but here's the proof...\nIF...Y+Z = 24 and Y= 2Z....\nY = 16\nZ = 8\nX is 1/4 of Z, so X = (1/4)(8) = 2\nX+Y+Z=26\n2+16+8=26\nAll of the numbers 'fit' what we were told, so this MUST be the answer.\nE", "difficulty_score": 10, "answer": "E"}

Another way to look at the formula is Sum = Average x Number of Terms. For the first purchase, the vendor's sum (total cost) was $140, since 14 x 10 = 140. For the second purchase, the vendor's cost was $165, since 11 x 15 = 165. The grand sum is then $140 + $165, which equals $305. The total number of shirts purchased was 25, so to get the average price per shirt, we divide 305 by 25, which equals $12.20. As a result, the correct answer is A.\nNOTE: A relative understanding of weighted average offers a shortcut to this problem. Because the true average of 11 and 14 is 12.5, but the vendor sells more shirts at the lower price than at the higher price, the weighted average must be less than $12.50; only answer choice A is a possibility.", "difficulty_score": 11, "answer": "A"}
