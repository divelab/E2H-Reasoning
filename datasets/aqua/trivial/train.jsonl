{"question":"A vendor buys 10 t-shirts at an average price of $14 per t-shirt. He then buys 15 more t-shirts at an average price of $11 per t-shirt. What is the average price D per t-shirt that the vendor paid for these purchases?","options":["A)$12.20","B)$12.50","C)$12.55","D)$12.70","E)$13.00"],"solution":"Correct Answer: A\nExplanation: The relevant formula for this problem is Average D= (Sum)\/(Number of Terms). Another way to look at the formula is Sum = Average x Number of Terms. For the first purchase, the vendor's sum (total cost) was $140, since 14 x 10 = 140. For the second purchase, the vendor's cost was $165, since 11 x 15 = 165. The grand sum is then $140 + $165, which equals $305. The total number of shirts purchased was 25, so to get the average price per shirt, we divide 305 by 25, which equals $12.20. As a result, the correct answer is A.\nNOTE: A relative understanding of weighted average offers a shortcut to this problem. Because the true average of 11 and 14 is 12.5, but the vendor sells more shirts at the lower price than at the higher price, the weighted average must be less than $12.50; only answer choice A is a possibility.","answer":"A","difficulty":8}

The question asks for the probability of lasso-ing a cow AT LEAST ONCE in 5 attempts.\nWhen it comes to probability questions, there are only 2 things that you can calculate: what you WANT to have happen OR what you DON'T WANT to have happen. Those two fractions will always add up to 1. Sometimes it's much easier to calculate what you DON'T WANT and then subtract that fraction from 1 (which will give you the probability of what you DO want).\nHere, the work that would be required to calculate 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 lasso-ings of a cow would take some time and effort. It's far easier to calculate what we DON'T WANT (0 lasso-ings) and subtract that fraction from 1.\nThe probability of NOT lasso-ing the cow on 5 attempts is:\n(1\/2)(1\/2)(1\/2)(1\/2)(1\/2) = 1\/32\n1 - 1\/32 = 31\/32\nThe probability of lasso-ing a cow AT LEAST ONCE in 5 attempts is 31\/32\nFinal Answer:\nD","answer":"D","difficulty":4}
