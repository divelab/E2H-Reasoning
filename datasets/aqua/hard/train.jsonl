We can examine the x and y coordinates separately since they are independent.\n*It should be noted that there are two solutions to this problem, one point between C and D, and another point with D in the middle of C and the point. We can quickly look at the answer choices and see that all the points are between C and D, therefore we can search for that point using the following method:\nTaking the x-coordinate first, the distance between C and D is |(x-coordinate of C) - (x-coordinate of D)|= |5 - (-1)| = 6\nThe x-coordinate that is twice as far from C as it is from D (and in between C and D) will be 4 units from C and 2 units from D. So the x coordinate of the point we're looking for is 5-4 = 1, or (-1)+2 = 1.\nNow looking at the y-coordinate, we do the same thing. The distance between C and D is |(-2) - 2.5| = 4.5\nThe y-coordinate that is twice as far from C as it is from D (and in between C and D) will be 3 units from C and 1.5 units from D. So the y coordinate of the point we're looking for is (-2)+3 = 1, or 2.5-1.5 = 1.\nSo now we have our coordinates of the point on the line that is twice as far from C as it is from D: (3,0.5)\nAnswer: D","answer":"D","difficulty":19}

If team A's average speed was 5 mph greater than team R's, what was team R's average mph?","options":["A)12","B)15","C)18","D)20","E)25"],"solution":"This is a very specific format that has appeared in a handful of real GMAT questions, and you may wish to learn to recognize it: here we have a *fixed* distance, and we are given the difference between the times and speeds of two things that have traveled that distance. This is one of the very small number of question formats where backsolving is typically easier than solving directly, since the direct approach normally produces a quadratic equation.\nSay Team R's speed was s. Then Team R's time is 300\/s.\nTeam A's speed was then s+5, and Team A's time was then 300\/(s+5).\nWe need to find an answer choice for s so that the time of Team A is 3 less than the time of Team R. That is, we need an answer choice so that 300\/(s+5) = (300\/s) - 3. You can now immediately use number properties to zero in on promising answer choices: the times in these questions will always work out to be integers, and we need to divide 300 by s, and by s+5. So we want an answer choice s which is a factor of 300, and for which s+5 is also a factor of 300. So you can rule out answers A and C immediately, since s+5 won't be a divisor of 300 in those cases (sometimes using number properties you get to the correct answer without doing any other work, but unfortunately that's not the case here). Testing the other answer choices, if you try answer D, you find the time for Team R is 15 hours, and for Team A is 12 hours, and since these differ by 3, as desired, D is correct.","answer":"D","difficulty":19}

We can examine the x and y coordinates separately since they are independent.\n*It should be noted that there are two solutions to this problem, one point between C and D, and another point with D in the middle of C and the point. We can quickly look at the answer choices and see that all the points are between C and D, therefore we can search for that point using the following method:\nTaking the x-coordinate first, the distance between C and D is |(x-coordinate of C) - (x-coordinate of D)|= |5 - (-1)| = 6\nThe x-coordinate that is twice as far from C as it is from D (and in between C and D) will be 4 units from C and 2 units from D. So the x coordinate of the point we're looking for is 5-4 = 1, or (-1)+2 = 1.\nNow looking at the y-coordinate, we do the same thing. The distance between C and D is |(-2) - 2.5| = 4.5\nThe y-coordinate that is twice as far from C as it is from D (and in between C and D) will be 3 units from C and 1.5 units from D. So the y coordinate of the point we're looking for is (-2)+3 = 1, or 2.5-1.5 = 1.\nSo now we have our coordinates of the point on the line that is twice as far from C as it is from D: (3,1)\nAnswer: E","answer":"E","difficulty":20}

You don't need to use that formula here, though it's not all that straightforward to solve without one. Two different approaches:\n16^2 + 17^2 + 18^2 + ... + 30^2 = (15 + 1)^2 + (15 + 2)^2 + (15 + 3)^2 + ... + (15 + 15)^2\nNow we can expand each square; they are all in the (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 pattern.\n= (15^2 + 2*15 + 1^2) + (15^2 + 4*15 + 2^2) + (15^2 + 6*15 + 3^2) + ... + (15^2 + 30*15 + 15^2)\nNow we have fifteen 15^2 terms, so adding these gives 15*15^2 = 15^3 = 3375. We also have the entire sum 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 15^2, which we know is equal to 1240. Finally adding the middle terms, we have:\n2*15 + 4*15 + 6*15 + ... + 30*15 = 15(2 + 4 + 6 + .... + 30) = 15*2*(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 15) = 15*2*8*15 = 3600\nSo the sum must be 3375 + 1240 + 3600 = 8215\nAlternatively, we can use a different factoring pattern. We want to find the value of 30^2 + 29^2 + ... + 17^2 + 16^2. Well if we subtract 15^2 + 14^2 + .... + 2^2 + 1^2 from this, the answer will be 1240 less than what we want to find. So if we can find the value of\n30^2 + 29^2 + ... + 17^2 + 16^2 - (15^2 + 14^2 + .... + 2^2 + 1^2)\nthen we can add 1240 to get the answer. Now grouping the terms above to get differences of squares, we have\n= (30^2 - 15^2) + (29^2 - 14^2) + ... + (16^2 - 1^2)\nand factoring each of these using x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y), we have\n= 45*15 + 43*15 + 41*15 + ... + 17*15 = 15(45 + 43 + 41 + ... + 17)\nIn brackets we have an equally spaced sum with fifteen terms, which we can evaluate using the familiar formula. So the above equals\n15*15*62\/2 = 6975\nand adding back the 1260, we get the answer of 8235. (ANS D)","answer":"D","difficulty":20}

This means that your goal is to get the equations in terms of B and J so that you can solve for the expression B - J.\nTaking the first equation and solving for B, you have B = M - 3.\nTaking the second equation and solving for J you have J = W - 3, and then with the third equation you can replace W with 1 + M so that both B and J are in terms of M: J = (1 + M) - 3.\nSo if B = M - 3 and J = M - 2, then:\nB - J = (M - 3) - (M - 2)\nB - J = M - 3 - M + 2 (remove the parentheses by distributing the multiplication)\nB - J = -1, so the answer is E.","answer":"E","difficulty":20}
