{"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?","options":["A)5(\u221a3 + 1)","B)6(\u221a3 + \u221a2)","C)7(\u221a3 \u2013 1)","D)8(\u221a3 \u2013 2)","E)None of these"],"solution":"Explanation :\nLet the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h\/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h\/x x = h\/\u221a3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h \u2013 x = h - h\/\u221a3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 \u2013 1\u221a3)\nh can be travelled in 10 \/ (1 \u2013 1\u221a3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h\/\u221a3, it takes :\nh = 10 \/ (1 \u2013 1\/\u221a3)\nh \/ \u221a3 = 10\/ \u221a3 * (1 \u2013 1\/\u221a3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + \u221a3 ( conjugate of 1 - \u221a3). We get, x = h\/\u221a3 = 10 (1 + \u221a3) \/ 2 = 5* (1 + \u221a3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + \u221a3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A","answer":"A","difficulty":20}

If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?","options":["A)15","B)16","C)17","D)18","E)19"],"solution":"Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x\/7, and Jacob is y\/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.\n=> x\/7 + y\/9 = 35.\n=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)\n=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x\n=> y = (5)(63) - (9\/7)x\n=> y = 315 - (9\/7)x\n=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,\nx = 126, y = 315 - (9\/7)126 = 153\nx = 133, y = 315 - (9\/7)133 = 144\nx = 140, y = 315 - (9\/7)140 = 135\nx = 147, y = 315 - (9\/7)147 = 126\nAs we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y\/9 = 135\/9 = 15.\nAnswer: A","answer":"A","difficulty":20}

{"question":"A bag contains 11 candy bars: three cost 50 cents each, four cost $1 each and four cost $2\neach. How many ways can 3 candy bars be selected from the 11 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4?","options":["A)8","B)28","C)46","D)66","E)70"],"solution":"The ways of choosing 3 candy bars with a total cost over $4 include: choose 3 out of 4 (2 dollars each); choose 2 out of 4 (2 dollars each) and 1 from the other 7. So, the total number of ways is C4\n3 + (7 C4\n2 ) = 46. Incidentally, the total number ways of choosing 3 candy bars out of 11 is C11\n3 = 165. So the probability of them costing more than $4 if they are randomly chosen is\nC4\n3 + (7 C4\n2 )\nC11\n3\n=\n46\/165\ncorrect answer C","answer":"C","difficulty":19}
