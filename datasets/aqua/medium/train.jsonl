If z represents the area of the figure formed by the intersecting lines and the x-axis, what is the side length of a cube whose surface area is equal to 6z?","options":["A)16","B)8\u221a2","C)8","D)7\/\u221a2","E)(\u221a2)\/3"],"solution":"800score Official Solution:\nThe first step to solving this problem is to actually graph the two lines. The lines intersect at the point (-7, -7) and form a right triangle whose base length and height are both equal to 4. As you know, the area of a triangle is equal to one half the product of its base length and height: A = (1\/2)bh = (1\/2)(7 \u00d7 7) = 49\/2; so z = 49\/2.\nThe next step requires us to find the length of a side of a cube that has a face area equal to 49\/2. As you know the 6 faces of a cube are squares. So, we can reduce the problem to finding the length of the side of a square that has an area of 49\/2. Since the area of a square is equal to s\u00b2, where s is the length of one of its side, we can write and solve the equation s\u00b2 = 49\/2. Clearly s = \u221a49\/2 = 7\/\u221a2 , oranswer choice (D).","answer":"D","difficulty":17}

We can examine the x and y coordinates separately since they are independent.\n*It should be noted that there are two solutions to this problem, one point between C and D, and another point with D in the middle of C and the point. We can quickly look at the answer choices and see that all the points are between C and D, therefore we can search for that point using the following method:\nTaking the x-coordinate first, the distance between C and D is |(x-coordinate of C) - (x-coordinate of D)|= |5 - (-1)| = 6\nThe x-coordinate that is twice as far from C as it is from D (and in between C and D) will be 4 units from C and 2 units from D. So the x coordinate of the point we're looking for is 5-4 = 1, or (-1)+2 = 1.\nNow looking at the y-coordinate, we do the same thing. The distance between C and D is |(-2) - 2.5| = 4.5\nThe y-coordinate that is twice as far from C as it is from D (and in between C and D) will be 3 units from C and 1.5 units from D. So the y coordinate of the point we're looking for is (-2)+3 = 1, or 2.5-1.5 = 1.\nSo now we have our coordinates of the point on the line that is twice as far from C as it is from D: (3,0.5)\nAnswer: D","answer":"D","difficulty":18}

We can apply the \u201c1 \u2013 x\u201d technique: what\u2019s the chance that more than 1\/3 of the original investment is lost? There are two outcomes we have to separately measure:\n(a) All 3 investments become worthless.\n(b) 2 of the 3 investments become worthless, while 1 doesn\u2019t.\nOutcome (a): The probability is (0.2)(0.2)(0.2) = 0.008, or a little less than 1%.\nOutcome (b): Call the investments X, Y, and Z. The probability that X retains value, while Y and Z become worthless, is (0.8)(0.2)(0.2) = 0.032. Now, we have to do the same thing for the specific scenarios in which Y retains value (while X and Z don\u2019t) and in which Z retains value (while X and Y don\u2019t). Each of those scenarios results in the same math: 0.032. Thus, we can simply multiply 0.032 by 3 to get 0.096, or a little less than 10%.\nThe sum of these two probabilities is 0.008 + 0.096 = 0.104, or a little more than 10%. Finally, subtracting from 100% and rounding, we find that the probability we were looking for is approximately 90%.\nThe correct answer is A.\nThis problem illustrates the power of diversification in financial investments. All else being equal, it\u2019s less risky to hold a third of your money in three uncorrelated (independent) but otherwise equivalent investments than to put all your eggs in one of the baskets. That said, be wary of historical correlations!

The lines intersect at the point (-4, -4) and form a right triangle whose base length and height are both equal to 4. As you know, the area of a triangle is equal to one half the product of its base length and height: A = (1\/2)bh = (1\/2)(4 \u00d7 4) = 8; so z = 8.\nThe next step requires us to find the length of a side of a cube that has a face area equal to 8. As you know the 6 faces of a cube are squares. So, we can reduce the problem to finding the length of the side of a square that has an area of 8. Since the area of a square is equal to s\u00b2, where s is the length of one of its side, we can write and solve the equation s\u00b2 = 8.

Since this is a problem-solving question, and there can only be one correct answer, we can select any value for p, as long as it is a prime number greater than 2. We always want to work with small numbers, so we should select 3 for p. Thus, we have:\nn = 4 x 3\nn = 12\nNext we have to determine all the factors, or divisors, of P. Remember the term factor is synonymous with the term divisor.\n1, 12, 6, 2, 4, 3\nFrom this we see that we have 4 even divisors: 12, 6, 2, and 4.\nIf you are concerned that trying just one value of p might not substantiate the answer, try another value for p. Let\u2019s say p = 5, so\nn = 4 x 5\nn = 20\nThe divisors of 20 are: 1, 20, 2, 10, 4, 5. Of these, 4 are even: 20, 2, 10 and 4.

So, using simpler numbers, suppose you know that 6 identical employees, working simultaneously, would finish a job in 5 hours. Then that job requires 6*5 = 30 total hours of person-work. If instead you wanted the job done in 3 hours, you'd assign 30\/3 = 10 employees to do the job, because you want to get a total of 30 hours of work from the employees.\nWe can solve this problem identically. If 15 machines (identical ones, I assume) work simultaneously for 36 days, they will do a total of 15*36 machine-days of work. So the job requires 15*36 days of machine work in total. We instead want the job done in 1\/4 less time, so in 27 days. So we'll need 15*36\/27 = 20 machines, or 5 additional machines.\nA","answer":"A","difficulty":18}

{"question":"When positive integer n is divided by 5, the remainder is 1. When n is divided by 7, the remainder is 3. What is the smallest positive integer k such that k + n is a multiple of 75.","options":["A)3","B)4","C)12","D)32","E)35"],"solution":"First, let us say I have a number n which is divisible by 5 and by 7. We all agree that it will be divisible by 35, the LCM of 5 and 7.\nNow, if I have a number n which when divided by 5 gives a remainder 1 and when divided by 7 gives a remainder 1, we can say the number is of the form\nn = 5a + 1 e.g. 5 + 1, 10 + 1, 15 + 1, 20 + 1, 25 + 1, 30 + 1, 35 + 1 etc\nand\nn = 7b + 1 e.g. 7 + 1, 14 + 1, 21 + 1, 28 + 1, 35 + 1 etc\nSo when it is divided by the LCM, 35, it will give 1 as remainder (as is apparent above)\nNext, if I have a number n which when divided by 5 gives a remainder 1 and when divided by 7 gives a remainder 3, we can say the number is of the form\nn = 5a + 1\nand\nn = 7b + 3\nNow, the only thing you should try to understand here is that when n is divided by 5 and if I say the remainder is 1, it is the same as saying the remainder is -4. e.g. When 6 is divided by 5, remainder is 1 because it is 1 more than a multiple of 5. I can also say it is 4 less than the next multiple of 5, can't I? 6 is one more than 5, but 4 less than 10.\nTherefore, we can say n = 5x - 4 and n = 7y - 4 (A remainder of 3 when divided by 7 is the same as getting a remainder of -4)\nNow this question is exactly like the question above. So when you divide n by 75, remainder will be -4 i.e. n will be 4 less than a multiple of 75. So you must add 35 to n to make it a multiple of75\nE","answer":"E","difficulty":16}

If the 3 letters are to be put into the four envelopes at random, what is the probability that only one letter will be put into the envelope with its correct address?","options":["A)1\/24","B)1\/8","C)1\/4","D)1\/3","E)3\/8"],"solution":"I hope you are familiar with basic probability fundas -\nLet's say you have just ONE letter and TWO envelopes ONE of which is correctly addressed and the other addressed incorrectly.\nWhat's the probability of putting the Letter in the correctly addressed envelope -\nTo answer this question - we see IN HOW MANY WAYS can the letter be put into the envelope - you could put it (assuming you don't know which envelope is which) in either of the two - so in total you have TWO ways of shoving the letter in. However, there's only ONE way in which it can go into the correctly addressed envelope -\nso 1\/2 is the prob of putting in correct envelope. This is easy.\nNow in our current problem - let's say we have just ONE letter but FOUR envelopes. Only one of these envelopes has the address corresponding to the letter. The remaining three envelopes are incorrectly addressed.\nSo the probability that you will put the letter correctly is 1\/4. Right?\nWhat happens if i ask you the reverse question? what is the prob for putting it in the incorrect envelope. Suddenly you have three envs that are incorrect so you can put the letter incorrectly with a prob of 3\/4. Right?\nThe whole problem can be broken down into Four Events that will fulfill the requirement of the question\nEvent 1 - E1\nWe know that prob of putting ONE Letter correctly is 1\/4. Now once ONE letter has been put CORRECTLY, what are you LEFT with? You are left with THREE ENVELOPES and the remaining THREE letters. Since the one letter has been put correctly (though technically we have just calculated the PROBABILITY that the first letter goes into the correct envelope) we have the remaining THREE Letters and THREE envelopes.\nEvent 2 - E2\nLet's take letter number 2 now - what is the probability that it LANDS in the INCORRECT envelope. Again by the same logic as above - there are 3 envelopes remaining out of which ONLY ONE has the correct address for LETTER number 2. The remaining 2 have INCORRECT address and LETTER NUMBER 2 could go in either of these 2 to meet our condition.\nThus the probability of this event is 2\/3\nSo till now what we have done is -\nwe have calculated the prob of shoving Letter number 1 in correct env -- 1\/4\nwe have calculated the prob of shoving Letter number 2 in INcorrect env --- 2\/3\nEvent 3 - E3\nNow let's take letter number 3 - again according to question we want to shove this in the WRONG envelope. There are 2 remaining envelopes and hence the prob of shoving this in the wrong env (or equally in the RIght env) is 1\/2.\nFinally we come to event E4 - the Letter number 4. This has only one way of going in so its probability of being put into the WRONG envelope is 1.\nok so we can see that our grand event is actually a combination of FOUR EVENTS happening - each with a probability of its own. So to calculate the total probability of the Grand Event itself we just multiply the individual probabilities since each event happens INDEPENDENTLY of each other\nEgrand = 1\/4 * 2\/3 * 1\/2 * 1\/1 = 1\/12\nHowever at this point - I must introduce one last element in this question -since there are FOUR Letters - what we saw above was JUST ONE SEQUENCE of events leading to the desired result.\nIf we arbitrarily call the letters L1 thru L4, and let's say the above was an example in which we started by Picking up Letter L1 and worked thru the remaining letters, we could have equally well started out with letter L2 or L3 or L4.\nThus since each of these events ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, meaning THEY CAN NEVER HAPPEN ALL THE SAME TIME BUT ONLY ONE LETTER AT A TIME, to calculate the TOTAL PROBABILITY of we will add the individual probabilities 1\/12 + 1\/12 + 1\/12 + 1\/12 which works out to 1\/8.\nB","answer":"B","difficulty":18}

For example, in many work-rate questions, it helps if you figure out the situation in which the rate of both people is the same.\nHere the average speed of A (assuming guy who starts from A is A) is 3 mph and distance is 48 miles. So this means that A would take a total of 48\/3 = 16 hours to cover the distance from A to B. So, if B's speed were also 3, both A and B would travel for 8 hours to meet in the middle.\nMeanwhile, B will start at 4 mph, but during the next hour (because of his break) he will only travel 2 miles. This pattern will continue: 4, 2, 4, 2... meaning B will end up with an average speed of 3 mph for every two-hour period.
