We can set up equations for income before and after the wage reduction. Initially, the employee earns W wage and works H hours per week. After the reduction, the employee earns .8W wage and works X hours. By setting these equations equal to each other, we can determine the increase in hours worked: WH = .8WX (divide both sides by .8W) 1.25H = X We know that the new number of hours worked will be Q=25% greater than the original number.
