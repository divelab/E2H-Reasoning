  user_content: "I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do
    \n
    Pick up a block
    Unstack a block from on top of another block
    Put down a block
    Stack a block on top of another block
    \n
    I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.\nI can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
    I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear.
    A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
    I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
    I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
    Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
    I can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
    I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
    Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
    \n
    Here is the format of the actions: 
    pick up the [block_name] block
    unstack the [block_name] block from on top of the [another_block_name] block
    put down the [block_name] block
    stack the [block_name] block on top of the [another_block_name] block
    \n
    [Problem]
    Here is the initial state of the blocks: {question}
    Here is the goal state of the blocks: {answer}. Show your work in <think> </think> tags. After that, provide the final answer in <answer> </answer> tags, for example <answer>
    unstack the cyan block from on top of the emerald block
    put down the cyan block</answer>\n"
